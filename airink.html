            <h1>AirInk</h1>
            <p id="long_text">Air Ink designed our proprietary technology to sequester PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions (PM
                Air Pollution).
                Next they analyze and further segregate the pollution particulate for recycling with help of global
                accredited labs. The analysis further ensure that the AIR-INK® formulations we resolve to are safe for
                consumer use.
            </p>
            <p id="tablet_text">The PM air pollution waste is sequestered as useable pigments and ink. They still test
                the inks for
                safety and steadfastness also they are trying to improve and advance this process. Different grades
                of
                AIR-INK are classified and are used by their partners to 'Print with pollution' to offset carbon
                footprint and gain significant advertising and marketing advantage.
