            <h1>Pinatex</h1>
            <p id="long_text">Material is made from the byproduct of the pineapple plant, which is traditionally
                discarded or burned. Pinatex works directly with farmers creating for them additional income. Once the
                fibre has been stripped from the leaf the leftover biomass can be retained to use as a natural
                fertiliser or bio-fuel, offering a further environmental prospect.

            <p id="tablet_text">Pinatex Leather product made from a really rare idea. It is a business that allows
                farmers to derive financial benefits from growing pineapples, while the produced material does not harm
                the environment

                Ananas Anam is a for-profit company with a positive social impact and low environmental impact. The idea
                began in the 1990s by shocked leathergoods expert at the environmental impact of mass leather production
                and chemical tanning. Inspired by the abundance of natural resources, Dr Carmen Hijosa got an idea about
                a non-woven textile that could be commercially produced. The idea acquired positive social and economic
                impact without littering the planet.

            <p id="section_2_text_normal">Ananas Anam wants to meet the challenges of our times by developing innovative
                products in which commercial success is integrated with, and promotes, social, ecological and cultural
                development. Pinatex is an innovative textile created as a not harming alternative to animals leather

                After pineapple harvest, the suitable plant leaves which are left behind are collected in bundles and
                the long fibres are extracted. The fibres are washed, then go through a purification process to remove
                any impurities which results in a fluff-like material. This fluff-like pineapple leaf fibre gets mixed
                with a corn-based polylactic acid and undergoes a mechanical process to create Pinafelt, a non-woven
                mesh that forms the base of all Pinatex collections. The rolls of Pinafelt are then shipped by boat from
                the Philippines to Spain or Italy to make the Original. Pinatex is fit for use across fashion,
                accessories & upholstery and has been used by over 1000 brands worldwide including Hugo Boss, H&M and
                the Hilton Hotel Bankside.
